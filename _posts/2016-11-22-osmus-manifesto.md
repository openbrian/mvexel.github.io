In my manifesto for last year's OSM US board elections, I [spoke of](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/mvexel/diary/36087) doubling the amount of mappers in the US.

It looks like I failed miserably.

[Daily active mappers in the US](http://osmstats.neis-one.org/?item=members&country=United%20States) show almost no growth at all. Things look a little more hopeful if we look at [global metrics for Weekly and Monthly active mappers](http://osmstats.neis-one.org/?item=members):

There are no metrics I know of that show me how many weekly or monthly active mappers for the U.S. alone.

I outlined a few ways in which I thought we could achieve the desired growth in active mappers: more and smaller OSM US events, putting local mapping groups first, and encouraging companies to publish more useful tools.

We did not see smaller events supplant or supplement SOTM US this year. Instead we had another monolithic SOTM US. The much heavier involvement of the local OSM group from the Seattle area was fantastic to have, and it di dreal

In putting local mapping groups first, we made some progress. We now have a small grants program through which we sponsor local groups who want to organize mapping parties or start other local initiatives.
