Week 2 has been quiet. I enjoyed it.

It was fun **being a novice again** at a few things. 

I started a daily practice of **meditative mindfulness** exercises. An [app named Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app) helps me do this. I first downloaded it last fall and tried its 10-minute introductory sessions a few times, but it didn't stick. I decided to make it a part of my daily routine, doing the now 15-minute sessions first thing in the morning. 

It is hard to do for me but I am enjoying it greatly. I am noticing a great deal of variance in the amount of wandering my mind wants to do during the sessions. Not resisting that wandering is hard but I am learning. Mindfulness is starting to infuse my mind outside of the sessions as well, which is a good feeling. 

I also started **yoga**. I see this as a physical extension of the mindfulness sessions. I only had one session so far so I can not say too much about it, other than that it is more physically demanding than I thought it would be.

Finally, I started a course on **machine learning** from Stanford. You can choose to follow it classroom style [through their own web site](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229) or MOOC style through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). (What a time to be alive - the amount of free education offered online is incredible. The value of formal college degrees will go [the way of NYC taxi medallions](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/07/31/428157211/episode-643-the-taxi-king) soon.) 

I finished the first week of the course. It re-introduced me to some basic elements of probability theory and linear algebra. I had not thought about these things since college and it is invigorating to do so again.

I started gathering some **data on my habits**. I use a Google form for this that I complete at the end of each day. It looks like this right now:

There are two criteria for a habit or daily practice to be on there. 1) It will help me be a happier person. 2) It takes effort / reminding.

I didn't read hardly at all this week. I started reading **[Choose Yourself](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/books/)** last week but decided to put it down a little over halfway in. James Altucher is a very smart guy and the book contains very useful advice that I am already taking to heart, but he did not need 200+ pages to give it to me. It feels like an edited collection of blog posts that have a fair amount of overlap. Read [his blog post on the daily practice](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/how-to-be-the-luckiest-guy-on-the-planet-in-4-easy-steps/) and you have the gist of what the book tries to tell you.

I spent some time walking around and **taking pictures** of Salt Lake City, capturing one of its lifeless winter Sundays. The title photo is from that session, as is the photo below.
