We picked up *Jerusalem* by Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi today. At Costco of all places. I started leafing through it right away, having enjoyed so many of the fabulous recipes from *Plenty*. A dish called *Sabih* caught my eye: simple and messy and colorful and it has fried eggplant. Plus I already had 90% of the ingredients, so I made it. I used pitas instead of white bread. Wonderful. The cilantro-based chili paste called Zhoug is extremely easy to make and will work really well with lots of Mediterranean dishes. Or on a sandwich. Or by itself on a piece of crusty bread.

The Guardian [has the recipe](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/15/yotam-ottolenghi-sabih-recipe) if you do not own the book. I think it would be wonderful as a hearty breakfast as well.
