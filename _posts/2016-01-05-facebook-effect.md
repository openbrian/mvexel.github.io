Just finished reading this.

The Facebook Effect by David Kirkpatrick was published in 2010 and parts of it feel a bit long in the tooth. The last four chapters, dealing with the social impact of Facebook and projections about the future, can easily be skipped now. 

I enjoyed reading about the early years of Facebook, especially the post-dorm-room phase of late 2004 and 2005, where Zuckerberg and his small team were struggling with growth and identity in a period of rapid growth. It was super interesting to learn how Zuckerberg relied on folks like Sean Parker, Peter Thiel, and later Marc Andreessen and Sheryl Sandberg to help him navigate growth, investors and monetization.

The unique level of access Kirkpatrick had to key people, combined with his extensive industry network as senior tech editor for Fortune, really elevates the book to a level of insight, especially in Mark Zuckerberg's personal convictions and struggles, that not many other authors could have achieved.

Next up is 'Choose Yourself' by James Altucher. It feels self-helpy but I usually enjoy reading his insights on Quora and Medium, so what the heck. I am interested in hearing your reading tips!
